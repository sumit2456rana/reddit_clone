## :notebook_with_decorative_cover: Short Description
<p>
  A Reddit clone created using, React, Javascript and Tailwind CSS. In addition to the well-known infinite scrolling home page, I also included subreddits, pages dedicated to individual posts,  comment and nested comments, post submission, profile pages, and a number of dropdown menus with the search bar and notifications. Users have the ability to establish their own communities, like and comment on posts, and even create new ones. This document's end contains a comprehensive feature list.
